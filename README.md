# Project Overview

This repository contains six tasks focused on building a complete task management system, from frontend to backend, along with testing and debugging. Below is a breakdown of each task:

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1 – Responsive Web Page
**Feature:** Create a responsive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Utilize modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid) for responsiveness.
- Implement a clean and user-friendly UI.
- Ensure the page adapts to different screen sizes.

### Task 2 – To-Do List with Vanilla JS
**Feature:** Develop a simple to-do list application using Vanilla JavaScript.
- Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- Use `localStorage` to persist tasks.
- Implement event listeners for user interactions.

### Task 3 – Button with Hover Effect
**Feature:** Design a button with a hover effect.
- Use CSS transitions or animations.
- Ensure smooth and visually appealing effects.
- Maintain cross-browser compatibility.

### Task 4 – Node.js Backend with Task Routes
**Feature:** Build a simple Node.js backend to manage tasks.
- Use Express.js to create RESTful APIs.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Use a JSON file or a database (MongoDB) for storage.

#### Installation & Setup:
```sh
# Initialize Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install required dependencies
npm install express cors body-parser dotenv mongoose

# Run the server
node server.js
```

### Task 5 – React.js Frontend for Task Management
**Feature:** Develop a React frontend to interact with the backend.
- Implement task listing, adding, editing, and deleting functionalities.
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management.
- Fetch tasks from the backend API.

#### Installation & Setup:
```sh
# Create a React app
npx create-react-app task-manager
cd task-manager

# Install necessary packages
npm install axios react-router-dom

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### Task 6 – Testing and Debugging
**Feature:** Test and debug the project to ensure smooth functionality.
- Fix any UI/UX inconsistencies.
- Debug JavaScript errors.
- Test API responses using Postman or a similar tool.
- Use React Developer Tools for debugging the frontend.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience in web development, covering frontend, backend, and testing. By completing these tasks, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how to build a full-stack web application.
